I'm a big sci-fi nut.

I was brought up on a diet of Babylon 5, Red Dwarf and The Outer Limits.

Whilst B5 is definitely a favorite, I enjoy plenty of other series like FireFly, 
Star Wars and Star Trek.

I also read a lot of sci-fi and I have an extensive book collection of both classic author (Isaac Asimov, Arthur C Clarke, Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle) as well as more modern (Peter F. Hamilton, Alastair Reynolds).

Isaac Asimov's robot and foundation series have to be at the top of my favorite books.
