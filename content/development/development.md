I have been using computers for many years as a hobby and have been working a software developer for 13 years or so.
Programming has remained one of my favorite hobbies, 
although my experience means my approach has changed quite a bit since being a 13 year old experimenting.

Nothing captures my interest more than solving a complex problem and software development presents me with plenty of challenges!

You can see a few pieces of my work on github.
