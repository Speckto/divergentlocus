1. Welcome
==================================================================

Folder Size is a utility to aid in the process of file management.

Most modern PCs have hard drives in the region of 60GB 
(Giga-bytes) or more, which at the point of purchase seems ample 
for most needs. However users usually discover that after a period 
the system starts to slow down (if your using windows), and that 
60GB of disk space rapidly dwindles to a paltry 2GB or so which 
you know you should leave free to allow windows to run for a a 
few hours before it does an imitation of a man with no legs and 
falls over.

Folder size will scan your hard drive(s) and produce statistics 
about folder and file usage on the drive. This information can then 
be used to produce charts and tables, allowing you to decide what
parts of your hard drive may need trimming down to size.

It will not however actually allow you to delete files or folders
from within the program.



2. System Requirements
==================================================================
Note: These system requirements are a "best guess" estimate. The 
program has only been tested on a limited number of system, and
therefore may not be compatible with all system configurations.

Recommended System Requirements:
Processor        :  AMD K6-2/Intel Pentium running at 333Mhz
RAM              :  64MB (Recommend as much as possible)
Operating System : Windows 98/ME/2K/NT/XP
Sound		 : None required
Graphics	 : Must be capable of 640x480 High Colour mode

This product has only been tested on the following Operating Systems:
- Windows 2000
- Windows 98 SE



3. Installation
==================================================================
You will need to use a program such as WinZip (R) to extract the
.ZIP file containing the program to a folder, then run 
FolderSize.exe
-- But I guess you probably guessed that as your reading this 
   file!



4. The Interface
==================================================================
Once the program loads you are presented with a form which is 
divided into several parts. Across the top of the screen runs the 
tool bar, with a drop down list of all the available disk drives.

When you select one of these drives the program will scan the given 
drive folders and files, and display gathered information in the 
box below called the Tree View.

The Tree view gives and explorer-style view of the hard drive, with 
several additions.
a) The coloured bar indicates the percentage of the containing 
   folder that folder/File takes up
b) The number indicates the exact size of the file
c) Information about files in the folder are consolidated into one 
   item "[Files]". This will be coloured red if the program was 
   unable to obtain size information on one or more objects in this 
   entry. This will mean that the quoted size may not be accurate.

Clicking an item in the Tree View will be produce one of the 
following depending on which toolbar button is selected:
a) A detailed list of each folder, including a more detailed 
   description of each file.
b) A graph of the information gathered in (a)

Graphs can be printed, and saved as bitmap files. They can also be 
copied to the clipboard as an image.

The Table list can be saved out in HTML format which can be viewed 
in any modern Web Browser.



5. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
==================================================================
Q. I use other programs to display when a file was last accessed,
   will Folder Size affect this program?
A. Unfortunately, yes. Whenever the program access a drive to 
   determine disk space used by each folder, it must retrieve the
   file size of each file within that folder. As a result the 
   operating system updates the "Last Accessed" field of the file
   attributes.

Q. The program display the message in the status bar
   "Please wait calculating folder sizes..." and then appears to
   lock up.
A. Depending on the size of your hard drive, this may take a large
   amount of time. Scanning 11,000 files taking up 10.2GB on an
   ATA 66 hard drive takes about 2-3 seconds under Windows 98 SE.
   If you do think it has crashed, check the hard drive LED (usually
   displayed on the front of your computers case). If this is 
   flashing, or solid on then the program probably has NOT crashed.

Q. I get an "Out Of Memory" when I select a drive from the drop down
   list box error. What going on?
Q. I get an error message saying that it ran out of memory
A. The first time you select a drive in the list box, the program will
   scan that drive and calculate sizes, which take up memory. When 
   you select a different drive this data is retained (until program
   exit) for quick access. If you have many drives, the system may 
   run out of memory. Try quitting other programs, to free up system
   memory, or exit and reload the program.
   Alternatively, from the "Options" menu select "Low Memory Drive
   Scans". This should fix the problem.

Q. After trying the above, I still get the same error.
A. All I can suggest is trying to free more memory, by quitting
   background programs, including those listed at the bottom
   right of the task bar.
Q. I've found a bug!
A. Oh dear. Email me (see contact information)


6. Contact Information & Other bits
==================================================================
So who wrote this peice of software you may be asking.
The answer is quite simple: Me. Specto

I am writing this during my 2003 easter break. I have an
Industrial Placement interview with IBM in 3 days; and in
1 week and 3 days I start my Part 2 exams for my degree in
Computer Science.

Ths program was written in Delphi. Yes I know C would have been 
faster, but delphi is MUCH better when it comes do designing good 
interfaces quickly.

This program was created in the following computer
AMD Ahtlon XP 1800+ (1.5Ghz)
128MB Ram
20.5GB Hard disc
SB Live!
Creative GeForce 256 DDR
And it runs wonderfully.

Hope you enjoy the program,
Specto
