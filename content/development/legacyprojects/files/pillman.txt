.ZIP file containing the program to a folder, then run 
the executable file.
Please note all files in the archive must be extracted if the 
program is to run correctly. You must use the option "Use Folder 
Names" otherwise the program will complain it cannot find files.


4. Contact Information & Other bits
==================================================================
So who wrote this peice of software you may be asking.
The answer is quite simple: Me. Neil Potter.

Ths program was written in Delphi. Yes I know C would have been 
faster, but delphi is MUCH better when it comes do designing good 
interfaces quickly.

This program was created in the following computer
AMD Ahtlon XP 1800+ (1.5Ghz)
128MB Ram
20.5GB Hard disc
SB Live!
Creative GeForce 256 DDR
And it runs wonderfully.

Hope you enjoy the program,

Specto
