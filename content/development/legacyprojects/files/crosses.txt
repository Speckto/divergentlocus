So who wrote this peice of software you may be asking.
The answer is quite simple: Me. Specto

Ths program was written in Delphi. Yes I know C would have been 
faster, but delphi is MUCH better when it comes do designing good 
interfaces quickly.

This program was created in the following computer
AMD Ahtlon XP 1800+ (1.5Ghz)
128MB Ram
20.5GB Hard disc
SB Live!
Creative GeForce 256 DDR
And it runs wonderfully.

Hope you enjoy the program,

Specto
