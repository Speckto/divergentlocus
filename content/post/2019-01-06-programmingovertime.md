Software Development I loved a statement from cppcon "Software development is programming over time". This is very much "it" for me.

As a senior software developer, helping others to understand what makes software maintainable and understandable is most of my time.


Unfortunately, the best lesson for a junior developer is always time: writing code and coming back to it in 6 months and realising what you’ve forgotten.
