Myself and a few friends recently started playing [Path Of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/) which is an Action RPG akin to the Diablo series. We started this shortly after the recent Diablo mobile announcement but for me it was unrelated - I wanted something new to play and probably would have started on PoE irrespective.

I like PoE. It is well structured, and I think making skills 'gems' which randomly dropped then slotting them is a nice approach. I'm don't particularly like the colour-coding system for gems in items - this seems to be an annoying mechanism to make most items useless or expensive to correct.

The end-game mapping also looks to be pretty cool.

Thankfully I did some reading before I started - for new players finding a build is essential or you end up with a character which cannot complete some content.

Anyway, I'll see how long this keeps me interested.
