I received a free gift of Destiny 2 late last year and over Christmas I've been playing through the content.

I find the game to be enjoyable. For an MMO it does the story elements exceptionally well - the 'adventures' are more involving and don't skimp on providing actual story. The voice acting is as good as you'd expect in a single player game. Loot has mostly been unexciting so far but it is early days yet.

I've also taken part in some of the 'events' and these are also pretty enjoyable. 

The weirdest thing I find compared to other games is the social aspects. Local chat is basically empty so whilst you see lots of other players around there is little direct interaction. For 'events' at least, people just show up and tend to coordinate silently.
