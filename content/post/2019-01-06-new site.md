So, after working on the OV web-site and seeing how dated my own was, I decided to give it a refresh. Hasn't taken long to cobble something together using hugo and an off-the-shelf theme.

Some of the older content is gone - like the Delphi apps. I doubt most of these work on a modern system and even if they do they're over 20 years old.
