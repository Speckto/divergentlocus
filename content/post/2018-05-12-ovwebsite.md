The Octavian Vanguard web-site (the gaming clan I belong to) has been somewhat
neglected of late. It was running an ancient version of wordpress and pbphp both of which had major security holes.

So I volunteered to fix that. We've decided to migrate away from forums to usingDiscord, and wanted to simplify the site. It can be found [https://www.octavianvanguard.net/](here).

I decided to use [https://gohugo.io/](hugo) as a static site generator, picking up a good looking theme and reskinning it.
It's been quite an adventure exploring this new technology. My last site was php based which was a bit of a faf. Tools like hugo make maintenance so much simpler. 

The site moved from something custom to wordpress and on to my new version. Traces of all of these revisions existed in the upload area. It also allowed me to recover quite a bit of missing/broken content from the way-back machine which certainly stirred a few memories.
